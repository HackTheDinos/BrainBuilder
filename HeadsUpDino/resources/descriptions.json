This was a huge bipedal predator whose length could have reached over 12 m. Its weight ranged from one to four tons. Relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs, its three-fingered forelimbs were small, and the body was balanced by a long by a long and heavily muscled tail. Allosaurus lived in prehistoric forests, along rivers. Its remains have been discovered in Europe, Africa, and North America. As with most dinosaurs, its skull was full of cavities and comprised of narrow strips of bone, making the head highly flexible and agile, able to swallow huge chunks of meat. Its worn out teeth were falling out to be replaced by the growth of new ones.",

The Ankylosaurus had a massive tail club that it could use to generate a large amount of force, potentially breaking the bones of another dinosaur while defending itself. The Ankylosaurus was a large dinosaur. Scientists estimate it reached a length of around 9 metres (30 feet) and a weight of around 6000 kg (13000 lb).",
